# pyhasura

This module has been developed on behalf of online hasura hackathons

I have done some modifications in hasura-python module by Hasura team and provided some easy to go function calls and added a very cool feature.

Features:
	1)Added a subscript for RTDB(Real Time DataBase) which provides a synced database across all logged in devices.



Feel free to modify further :)
